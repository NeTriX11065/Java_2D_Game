# Horror game

## Introduction

My project will be a simple text horror game (**Name to be decided**). The main idea is a game that progresses by letting the player make 
decisions, almost like a multiple choice test where each decisions will affect how the story will end. The variety in
options will allow the player to have a unique experience after each run.

## Target Audience

This game is targeted towards players that enjoy a relaxing yet thrilling experience.

## Why I wanted to make this

I have always loved simple horror games containing short but interesting stories. The thought of making a
game that contained different endings also really appealed to me. As such, I saw a text game as the perfect fit for
these traits. The limitless possibilities inside of a text game is also a good opportunity to utilize my creativity.
