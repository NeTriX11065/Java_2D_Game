# Fortune Rush

## About my game

My project is a simple **Survive as long as possible** type game. The main idea is simply controlling a player that has 
to keep eating to survive as his health keep decreasing over time. As the player tries to survive, he is also able to 
pick up fortune cookies that will give him words of wisdom at the end of the game.
