# My Game

## About my game

My project will be a simple **tank** or *spaceship* type game. The main idea is simply you controlling one entity which 
has to fend off against enemies until you get overwhelmed and get a score or time survived at the end. The game will 
contain a simple GUI allowing the player to start and close the game. There will be the main entity which the player 
will be able to control as well as cpu controlled entity that the player will need to play against. I might also decide 
to add environment obstacles. The game itself will take place in the same window the menu will be in. People that are 
interested in my game will play it. I am interested in this project because I've always wanted to make game, so I saw 
this as a good opportunity to do so.

What it will contain
- Gui (menu and game will take place in same window)
- Main entity
- Opposing entities
- Environment obstacle maybe
